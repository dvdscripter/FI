#' Forest inventory equations and calculations with FI
#' 
#' That package was created because I can't find any free solution for these 
#' basic calculations also will serve as learning experience to create packages
#' in R.
#' 
#' Here I implement the three basic volume equations (Smalian, Newton, Huber) 
#' and form and stacking factors. From these you can gather many information
#' about a region log volume (mean and standard deviation). Later a new package 
#' will provide volumetric equations adjust.
